{"number":34,"title":"Provide RSS / Atom feed","body":"There was [a question](https://juxt-oss.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/298045-juxt-misc/topic/juxt.20blog/near/375914991) about whether there was an RSS feed available but it seems we never added/enabled it to this astro setup.\r\n\r\nWe definitely had it setup at some point previously, to syndicate with Planet Clojure:\r\nhttps://github.com/ghoseb/planet.clojure/blob/fe269a2c09c0d4d554ff58d4eae2a4bf4bc06a75/clojure/config.ini#L3417-L3420\r\n\r\nIn case its helpful to refer to, we configured a blog feed for the xtdb.com site (also using astro) with `astrojs/rss` in [this commit](https://github.com/xtdb/astro-site/commit/bcae40466fcc03be084f70a9048cc817a08162c4) (presumably just following the official docs https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/) - let me know if someone wants access to that org/repo but essentially the commit is just...\r\n\r\nCreating `src/pages/blog.xml.js`:\r\n```\r\nimport rss from '@astrojs/rss';\r\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\r\n\r\nexport async function get(context) {\r\n  const blog = await getCollection('blog');\r\n  return rss({\r\n    title: 'XTDB Blog',\r\n    description: 'Engineering insights and development updates',\r\n    site: context.site,\r\n    items: blog.map((post) => ({\r\n      title: post.data.title,\r\n      pubDate: post.data.date,\r\n      description: post.data.summary,\r\n      link: `/blog/${post.slug}`,\r\n    })),\r\n\r\n    trailingSlash: false,\r\n    customData: \"<author><name>JUXT Ltd</name><email>hello@xtdb.com</email></author>\"\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdating `src/layouts/main.astro` with:\r\n`<link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" href=\"/blog.xml\" title=\"XTDB Blog\">`\r\n\r\nUpdating `export default defineConfig({` in `astro.config.mjs` to include:\r\n`site: 'https://xtdb.com'` \r\n\r\nAnd adding `\"@astrojs/rss\": \"^2.3.2\"` to the package.json.","state":"open","updated_at":"2023-08-30T22:23:54Z","created_at":"2023-07-17T14:04:48Z","creator_user_login":"refset"}
